you have some genes in you.  when you make babies, each baby gets about 50% of
them. the question, how much of your genes get copied into babies as a function
of total number of babies that you make?  this script aims to answer just this.

simulating the percentage of your genes that you will replicate into babies,
under the assumption that you have 1000 genes, 500 of which gets delivered to a
male baby, and 500 of which gets delivered to a female baby, all while using
1000 trials.  the simulation results shouldn't change if we add more genes
instead of 1000 (bcoz of the law of large numbers).  results are below:

    if you make 1  baby   50%    of your genes are copied.
    if you make 2  babies 74.99% of your genes are copied.
    if you make 3  babies 87.48% of your genes are copied.
    if you make 4  babies 93.74% of your genes are copied.
    if you make 5  babies 96.87% of your genes are copied.
    if you make 6  babies 98.45% of your genes are copied.
    if you make 7  babies 99.22% of your genes are copied.
    if you make 8  babies 99.6%  of your genes are copied.
    ...
    if you make 19 babies 100%   of your genes are copied.
